This repo contains a website displaying information from news and weather APIs.

*Check out the [live site here](https://fac-23.github.io/preA-http-week2-AdamMiah/)!*

## Core Stories 
As a user, I want to:
- [x] See an interesting mashup of different data
- [x] Input information to change the displayed result
- [x] View the app on all of my devices

## Acceptance Criteria 
- [x] Query at least two APIs using fetch
- [x] Dynamic content generated with JS
- [x] A clearly defined user journey, documented in your readme
- [x] A responsive, mobile-first design
- [x] Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible

## Features: ðŸŒŸ
* News/Weather API information displayed.
* Consistent nav bar across all pages. 
* Display US/GB news via clicking on relevant tabs. 
* Search areas for weather.

## Learning: ðŸŒ±
* We can write code that executes asynchronously.
* We can use callbacks to access values that arenâ€™t available synchronously.
* We can use promises to access values that arenâ€™t available synchronously.
* We can use the fetch method to make HTTP requests and receive responses.
* We can configure the options argument of the fetch method to make GET and POST requests.
* We can use the map array method to create a new array containing new values.
* We can use the filter array method to create a new array with certain values removed.
* We can access DOM nodes using a variety of selectors.
* We can add and remove DOM nodes to change the content on the page.
* We can toggle the classes applied to DOM nodes to change their CSS properties.
* We can use consistent layout and spacing.
* We can follow a spacing guideline to give our app a consistent feel.
* We can debug client side JS in our web browser.
* We can use console.log() to help us debug our code.

## Improvements and future ideas: âœ¨
- Indicate that data is loading whilst fetching information.
- Display to the user when something goes wrong.
